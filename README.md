PetVision — Pet Skin Condition Detector
PetVision is a deep learning-based pet skin condition classifier that detects 6 common skin conditions in dogs from images using a fine-tuned ResNet50 model.
🔍 Conditions Detected
Condition	Description
Dermatitis	Skin inflammation
Fungal Infection	Fungal skin disease
Healthy	No condition detected
Hypersensitivity	Allergic skin reactions
Demodicosis	Mite-caused skin condition
Ringworm	Fungal ring-shaped infection
🧠 Model
